# Sketch Machine

The Sketch Machine (www.sketchmachine.net) wants you to draw; it's waiting for you. The Sketch Machine is a quick and easy way to create short, looping animations and to turn them into GIFs to share through the web. 

Sketch Machine was created by Casey REAS 2017-18, with help from GIPHY. It was created within the tradition of “direct animation” works by Len Lye and Stan Brakhage and exploratory drawing software like Kid Pix and TURUX.
