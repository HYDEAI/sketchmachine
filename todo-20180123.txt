Bugs / Regressions / Issues

- "Select All" for the timeline button isn't styled correctly

- Export speeds are still off, I tweaked but not quite right?
  . What is the precise math?

- Clicking and holding mouse without moving it no longer draws just once?

- Giphy export
  . Worked on FireFox OS X 10.10.3, but had to enable pop-ups 
  . Didn't go to Giphy site on Chrome OS X 10.13.3
    - Update: It worked, but the pop-up blocker so subtle,
      I didn't see it
  . Link to "Find all the Sketch Machines GIFs on Giphy."


Done

x Unicode figures in the buttons have different borders on different browsers
  x Arows too low within the button on some browsers
  x Stop/pause button is off center on some browsers/OSs
    . Firefox MacOS 10.13.3, too small and at the bottom
  x Switch to SVG image buttons?
  
o Clicking on a frame in the timeline doesn't jump to that frame
  . Right now, dragging works, but not clicking 
  . Update: fixed a little, but not 100%

o Explore additional Tools
  . Grid
  . Square
  . Compass

x Default to 512 resolution
  . I switched it, but I think retina devices go back to 1024
  . Too slow on my phone @ 1024
  . Hacked it a bit, not looking at the pixelDeviceRatio anymore

x Timeline should be taller, it shrinks on small screen sizes and it's difficult
  to get with fingers on a phone

x If more than one tool is selected, "sluggish" is diminishing, not sluggish
  . pulled it out of the "mark" functions
