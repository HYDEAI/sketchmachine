Bugs / Regressions / Issues

- "Select" for the timeline button isn't styled correctly
- If more than one tool is selected, "sluggish" is diminishing, not sluggish
- Unicode figures in the buttons have different borders on different browsers
  - Stop, arrows all too low within the button
- Timeline should be taller, it shrinks on small screen sizes and it's difficult
  to get with fingers on a phone
x Remove strikethrough from "Deselect" button
- Clicking on a frame in the timeline doesn't jump to that frame
  . Right now, dragging works, but not clicking 
x Point is drawing a single point, not a list like Plane and Line
- Giphy export
  . Worked on FireFox OS X 10.10.3, but had to enable pop-ups 
  . Didn't go to Giphy site on Chrome OS X 10.13.3
    - Update: It worked, but the pop-up blocker so subtle,
      I didn't see it
  . Link to "Find all the Sketch Machines GIFs on Giphy."
- Stop/pause button is off center on some browsers/OSs
  . Firefox MacOS 10.13.3, too small and at the bottom
- Export speeds are still off, I tweaked but not quite right
  . What is the math?
- Default to 512 resolution
  . I switched it, but I think retina devices go back to 1024
  . Too slow on my phone @ 1024
- Clicking and holding mouse without moving it no longer draws just once
